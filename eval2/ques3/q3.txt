String

it is a sequence of char .strings are objects
string class can be created and manipulated .

String s1=new String();

StringBuffer

StringBuffer is like a string but can be modified at any point in
time it contain some particular sequence of char  but the length and content of sequence can be changed 
it take string as argument 

stringBuffer s1=new stringBuffer(String str);

it is thread-safe 

and we can modified string without making new object of string such as concating ,reverse etc

StringBuilder 

it is same just the differance is it is not thread-safe
and slow .
